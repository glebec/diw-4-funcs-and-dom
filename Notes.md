# Notes

## Git

### Review

- Git is a Version Control System (VCS)
- Distributed VCS (or DVCS) also has ways to *share* and *merge* project
- It tracks changes to a project over time
- It allows you to make parallel versions of a project (i.e. if you want to experiment, modify some things, propose some changes... but have an easy way t1o restore your project state!)
- It lets multiple developers collaborate on a project

### Commands Demonstrated

```sh
git status  # shows the current state of your project (any changes?)
git log  # shows the history of previous changes
git add SOME_FILE_NAME  # tells git to track the changes of a new file
git commit -m 'SOME_MESSAGE_HERE'  # tells git to save the current project state
```
